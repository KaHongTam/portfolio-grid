            <p> What started as a simple bootcamp assignment ended up into a live site Kampany.nl where I can express 
                my experience from what I’ve learned in three months. With the help of my colleagues, I’ve learned 
                the first steps of being a front-end developer.</p>
            <h2>So how did this journey start anyway?</h2>
            <p>I was working for two years as a customer-service employee at
                <a href="https://jobs.teleperformance.nl/locaties/tilburg/" title="Click here to go to Teleperformance"
                target="_blank">Teleperformance</a> where I helped <a href="https:/www.kpn.com" title="Click here to go to KPN"
                target="_blank">KPN</a>  customers with their financial or technical difficulties. I really loved to help people but the calls 
                which I prefered the most were the technical ones. Many people called because they couldn't get their network started  or because 
                they couldn't open websites for some reason. And it were not only the elder who were facing these difficulties, even the young 
                ones weren't able to solve these problems themselves. Even though KPN has an information page about how to adress these problems, 
                customers said it's hard to find it on the website. This means that the website isn't userfriendly. That was something I 
                couldn't fix while working there.</p>
            <p>After two years I worked for an health insurance company called <a href="https://www.cz.nl" title="Click here to go to CZ">CZ</a>.
                Even though this was also helping people, which I really love, it just wasn't really the right place for me. I longed for 
                technical questions. Then an add by 
                <a href="https://www.codegorilla.nl" title="Click here to go to CodeGorilla">CodeGorilla</a>
                caught my attention. A bootcamp for people who would like to become a developer without any particular IT background. Even 
                though my supervisor would rather have me stay at CZ, she understood my decision and I quit my job there.</p>
            <p>Now, several weeks later, here I am, still developing myself and already able to make a portfolio online. Let's code!</p><br><br><br>
