            <p> What started as a simple bootcamp assignment, Kampany.nl ended up into a live site where I can express
                my experience from what I’ve learned in three months. With the help of my colleagues, I’ve learned the
                first steps of being a front-end developer. </p>
            <p>So how did this journey start anyway? I was working for two years as a customer-service employee at 
                <a href="https://jobs.teleperformance.nl/locaties/tilburg/" title="Click here to go to Teleperformance" target="_blank">Teleperformance</a>
                where I had to help <a href="https:/www.kpn.com" title="Click here to go to KPN" target="_blank">KPN</a> customers with their 
                financial or technical difficulties. While I really loved to help people, the calls which I prefered the most are the 
                technical ones. A lot of people call because they can't get their network operational or because they can't open websites 
                for some reason. And it's not only the elder who are facing these difficulties, even the young are having difficulties 
                to solve the problems themselves. Even though KPN does have an information page on how to adress the problems, they mostly
                say it's hard to find it on the website. This would mean that the website isn't userfriendly.
