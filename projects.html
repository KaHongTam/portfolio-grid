    <p>What started as a simple bootcamp assignment ended up into a live site Kampany.nl where I can express my experience from 
        what I’ve learned in three months. With the help of my colleagues, I’ve learned the first steps of being a front-end developer. </p>

    <h2>So how did this journey start anyway?</h2>
    <p> I was working for two years as a customer-service employee at Teleperformance where I helped KPN customers with their financial 
        or technical difficulties. I really loved to help people but the calls which I prefered the most were the technical ones. 
        Many people called because they couldn't get their network started or because they couldn't open websites for some reason. A
        nd it were not only the elder who were facing these difficulties, even the young ones weren't able to solve these problems 
        themselves. Even though KPN has an information page about how to adress these problems, customers said it's hard to find it 
        on the website. This means that the website isn't userfriendly. That was something I couldn't fix while working there. </p>
    <p> For two years I worked for an health insurance company called CZ. Even though this was also helping people, which I really love, 
        it just wasn't really the right place for me. I longed for technical questions. Then an add by CodeGorilla caught my attention. 
        A bootcamp for people who would like to become a developer without any particular IT background. Even though my supervisor 
        would rather have me stay at CZ, she understood my decision and I quit my job there.</p>
